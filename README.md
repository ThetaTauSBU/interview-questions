# Interview-Questions
This repository will be used to store a collection of technical interview questions that can be used for mock interview
sessions.
In order for a brother to participate in mock interview sessions they must have an interview problem prepared that they thoroughly understand. 
Please submit your problem to this repository to ensure no collisions occur. 
Along with the problem, test cases, edge cases, and corner cases should be submitted. 
# How to submit your problems and test cases
There be will be a directory created for each mock interview session. 
* Clone the repository and open up a new branch with your name.
* In that branch create a sub directory with your name inside of the directory for the upcoming interview session.
* Inside of this sub directory there should contain 2 files. 
* One file should be the problem description with test cases. The second file should be an explanation of the solution and coded solution.
# Mock Interview Sessions
Brothers will be assigned with one another and begin whiteboard mock interviews. One will play the role as interviewer, the other as interviewee. Once the problem is solved, they will switch roles and begin another mock interview.

**Neos will not have to prepare any questions, but will only be able to act as the interviewee.**
